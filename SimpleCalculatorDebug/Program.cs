/*
 * 
 * Create a basic calculator that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
 * breakpoints to debug and inspect the values of variables at each step.
 * 
 * Steps:
 * Write a program that takes two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /) as input.
 * Set breakpoints at the start of each operation (e.g., before addition, before division).
 * Use the debugger to step through the code and inspect the values of the numbers and the result.
 * Handle edge cases like division by zero and use breakpoints to see how the program behaves.
