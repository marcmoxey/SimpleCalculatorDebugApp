# Simple Calculator with Debugging

A basic calculator program written in C# that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This project focuses on using breakpoints and debugging tools to inspect variables and step through code execution.

## Features
- Takes two numbers and an operation (+, -, *, /) as input.
- Handles edge cases like division by zero.
- Uses breakpoints to debug and inspect values at each step.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. Set breakpoints in the code (e.g., before each operation).
4. Run the program in debug mode (`F5`).
5. Step through the code using `F10` (Step Over) and `F11` (Step Into) to inspect variables.

## Debugging Tips
- Use the **Locals** window to inspect variable values.
- Set conditional breakpoints to debug specific scenarios (e.g., division by zero).
